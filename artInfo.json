The history was of leaving the palace and being holy saint.

Amongst which the most prominent ones are as follows:\r\nI. When the little golden bird atop the serpents head above my golden statue will fly away straight to heaven, let it be known to my countrymen their Kings' soul shall follow the golden bird in its heavenward flight.\r\nII. For when the stone elephants erected on the stairway of Viswanath temple in front of the Royal Palace step down to the nearby three stone water spouts (Manga Hiti) and drink to their hearts\u2019 content, let it be known King Yog Narendra Malla is no more on Earth.\r\nIII. For when the golden-winged Gaurda seated on the stone pillar opposite the Krishna Temple will lay two pearls as big as the hens\u2019 egg, let it be known King Yog Narendra Malla is no more on Earth.\r\nTill the golden bird stays perched atop the serpents head, the elephants remain standing on the stairway, and the Gaurda doesn\u2019t lay pearls as large as hen\u2019s egg. Let my countrymen know that King Yog Narendra Malla is alive inside his Royal Palace.\r\nAfter proclaiming such impossible things, King Yog Narendra Malla disappeared from his royal palace. His whereabouts were unknown to his wife and daughters. when people heard that The king has died then 31 women went sati. But still, the people of Lalitpur believe that King Yog Narendra Malla is engaged in deep meditation somewhere inside the Royal Palace and he is alive and well.", "additional": "Figurative Sculpture", "phone": "", "email": "", "insta": "https://instagram.com/", "facebook": "https://facebook.com/", "recognition": "", "location": "Patan", "images": ["https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/King_Yog_Narendra_Malla.jpg", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/King_Yog_Narendra_Malla_9ftavDr.jpg", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/16df46eeae2eb13b7acdb38ba0645b50.jpg"], "image_name": "joon"}, "geometry": {"coordinates": ["85.3231324", "27.6727028"], "type": "Point"}}]}
