Kirat people are diverse and therefore their beliefs and deities vary. Birupakshya is also worshipped in South India as Virupaksha.\r\nAn idol of Virupaksha is located in the east of Pashupatinath temple on the right bank of the Bagmati river. Half of the body of Virupaksha lies inside the ground and another half above. The statue is believed to be emerging out slowly. It is believed that the world will be destroyed if the whole statue will come out. Virupaksha is also called kali because his full emergence will end the Kali Yuga.", "additional": "The more the Kali Yuga disappears, the more it is believed that the idol will come up. People who know him also call him the idol of Virupaksha. According to the Sanskrit dictionary, this idol is called \u2018Birupaksha\u2019 because it has an eye in Bitunga, because like Shivaji, this idol also has one eye on its forehead, but the popular folklore in the Kathmandu Valley introduces it as \u2018Birupaksha\u2019 or \u2018Kali\u2019.According to the popular folklore in Kathmandu Valley, \u2018Birupaksha\u2019 is the name of a Kiranti boy. When the boy was young, the boy\u2019s father went abroad to earn money as he had no property at home, but when his son was seven years old, his father did not return home.No matter how many places he searched for, he could not find his father, even though he was seventeen years old. Many years after the disappearance of the father and mother, the mother also went in search of the father and son. Coincidentally, the mother and son came to live in the same shelter. Mother looked young. The mother and son did not know each other, so they had intercourse. When they got up in the morning and started dating, they found out that they were their own mother and child. \r\n\r\nThe beginning of Kali Yuga was after that great sin of Virupaksha\u2019s motherhood. Even now, Kali is still in Nepal as an opponent! I don\u2019t know what the folklore of the mother says, but the son was moved by remorse. He asked Lord Pashupati Nath how he could atone for the sin of motherhood. Pashupati Nath is addicted to poison, cannabis and dhatura, so he told the boy that the sin of motherhood can be absolved only after eating 12 dharnis of copper. The boy has cooked in a pot to melt copper. After heating in the fire for a long time, it is seen that the copper has melted, but the smoke of the copper burning inside the pot has made the boy look black, dirty and ugly. Then the boy\u2019s name became \u2018Birupaksh\u2019 (folklore only understands the meaning of the name \u2018Virupaksh\u2019, \u2018Axis\u2019 does not seem to mean \u2018eyes\u2019). Feeling that Lord Pashupati had deceived him, Birupaksha wanders around the Pashupati area, abusing Shivaji and kicking his idol, and takes refuge in Lord Buddha. The Buddha gives him a rosary of Bodhichitta and instructs him to turn it around until it is untied. The Buddha\u2019s teaching was that when the garland is untied, your sins will be forgiven. Birupaksha turned the garland around where his idol is now, but the garland did not open. Desperate, Birupaksha saw a boy crawling on a stone until an iron sheet died and asked what he had done. The boy said, \u2018Look, my clothes are torn, so I tried to make a needle out of iron! It was Lord Buddha who came in the guise of a boy to inspire Virupaksha to work hard. After getting knowledge from the boy, the garland of Birupaksha was also loosened, but the devotees of Pashupatinath insulted Shivaji and kicked Virupaksha who was kicking his idol and buried him on the bank of the river Bagmati. In order to take revenge on the God who betrays him and the devotees who bury him on the ground, Virupaksha is forcing him to rise from the ground. At the end of Kali Yuga, it is believed that Virupaksha will come out completely. In Pashupati, the idol of a woman near the idol of Birupaksha is believed to be that of Virupaksha\u2019s mother (Kirantini or Yakshini).

Siddhi Narsingh Malla was a devout king, so when he had a new palace designed in Patan he got his architects to plan a shrine to all the gods in the main courtyard.\r\nWhen it was built in 1642, Tusa Hiti must have impressed everyone who visited. More than 50 stone carvings of deities adorned the stepwell into which crystal clear spring water gushed out of a shiny bronze spout guarded by figures of Laxmi Narayan and Garud. Above it, all was a miniature stone temple that pre-dated the nearby Krishna Mandir, and is now thought to be an architectural model for it.\r\nMore than 360 years later, and having survived at least five major earthquakes, Tusa Hiti still impresses devotees and visitors. The pantheon of exquisitely carved gods is regarded as the crown jewel of Kathmandu Valley's Malla period.\r\nHe abandoned his kingship in 1714 and died in 1732.", "art_background": "Garuda is quite easy to recognize the half-man and half-bird. It is seen in a kneeling position on top of a pillar and in the \u2018Namaskara mudra\u2019. Putting two and two together, one should be able to derive that the temple in front of any Garuda is a Vishnu temple because Garuda is the vehicle, devotee and loyal follower of Vishnu. One of the most beautifully crafted images of the Garuda is the one kneeling in front of the Changu Narayan temple. A close look at the face has made many historians conclude that this is what 5th-century ruler Mana Deva must have looked like. Around the neck of the Garuda one can also see a large Naga (divine serpent). Legend has it that Garuda is a solar deity. \r\nAt Hanuman Dhoka, in front of the Ganesh temple and Kasthamandap, there is a large and beautiful stone image of Garuda placed there in 1689 CE. Another beautiful image of the Garuda in a metal can be seen on top of a pillar in front of the famous Krishna temple in Patan Durbar Square", "additional": "Story:\r\nGaruda\u2019s mother had been made a slave by the mother of the Nagas. The Nagas put up a demand that she will be freed only if Garuda is able to bring them the elixir which gives them eternal life. As the story goes, Garuda was successful and on this way back met Vishnu who was very impressed with his honesty in not keeping the elixir for himself and thus granted Garuda eternal life as well, and made him his trusted mount or vehicle. Garuda would henceforth always have a high place in front of all Vishnu temples.\r\n \r\nThe Garuda then headed on to deliver the elixir to the Nagas, but was stopped by Indra, king of heaven, who kept the elixir for the gods. The Nagas, naturally did not believe the Garuda\u2019s story and hence they became enemies forever. The fight between the Garuda and Nagas results in drought and they have to be in harmony to have rain and good crops. They control the sun and rain. The Buddhist version of the story of the serpent around Garuda in the Kathmandu valley, including the one at Changu Narayan, is that there was a great battle between Garuda and the Takshak Naga. The Boddhisattwa of compassion, Avolokiteswara saw that the earth would dry up in the valley and cause human suffering and hence got the two to reconcile. The symbol of this coexistence is the Naga draped around the neck of the Garuda.\r\nIf you pull out a ten-rupee note, you will see the image of Vishnu mounted on the Garuda. The original stone image depicted in the banknote is found at the Changu Narayan temple compound. The image is called the Garuda Ashana Vishnu.\r\nEach year the people of Kathmandu participate in the chariot festivals of the white and red Avalokiteshwor or Karunamaya in order to express gratitude for rain and also to seek a good season ahead. As part of these festivals, the idols of Avalokiteshwor are bathed in great fanfare and the various jewellery and decorations taken out and cleaned. One of these pieces of jewelry is that of the Satya Naga. Again legend tells us that a Naga from the Nakku area of Lalitpur had taken a human form and had gone to watch the bathing ceremony at Lagankhel from atop the Ashoka stupa. He instructed his wife not to tell anyone where he had gone for fear of an attack by Garuda. The wife did not heed his warning and gave his whereabouts away to Garuda who pounced of him. The Naga asked the Garuda for a chance to go home and promised to come back. Having scolded his wife for not obeying him,  the Naga surrendered himself to the Garuda. Impressed by the honesty of the serpent, the Garuda took him to the bathing ceremony, named him the Satya Naga (truth serpent) and offered him to Avalokiteshwor.\r\n \r\nAnother time, another Naga and another fight. This time Garuda and Basuki Naga get into a fight. The Basuki is able to cleverly escape the claws of Garuda and hides in the Bagmati river. The Naga then began to meditate to ask Pashupatinath \u2013 the lord of the animals to come to his rescue. Lord Pashupatinath, impressed with the serpent\u2019s dedication decided to protect it from Garuda if it could stay close to him. Basuki Naga was very pleased and agreed to live in the Pashupati temple area. The Naga was then made responsible for the treasury at the temple. The Basuki Kshetra (area) of Pashupati is the temple built in the name of the treasurer Naga.", "phone": "", "email": "", "insta": "https://instagram.com/", "facebook": "https://facebook.com/", "recognition": "", "location": "", "images": ["https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/download.jfif", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/Krishna_Mandir_and_Garuda_Patan_Durbar_Square.jpg", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/caa79a_13c702db177740a2be2b716479dc7e1a_mv2.jpg", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/image.png", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/Khasarpana_Lokesvara.jpg"], "image_name": "joon"}, "geometry": {"coordinates": ["85.3231324", "27.6727028"], "type": "Point"}}, {"type": "Feature", "place_name": "\ud83c\udfa8 Statue of Yog Narendra Malla", "center": ["85.3231324", "27.6727028"], "place_type": ["artInfo"], "properties": {"artId": 2, "title": "Statue of Yog Narendra Malla", "names": "Little golden bird prosperity", "date": "", "artist": "Yog Narendra Malla", "category": "Sculpture", "source": "https://www.windhorsetours.com/blog/patan-living-with-the-gods/", "excerpt": "As we walk around the magnificent Patan Durbar Square, we notice three stone pillars of which the biggest one has the image of Malla ruler Yog Narendra with a snake canopy and a \u201cgolden\u201d bird on top.", "artist_background": "Yog Narendra came to the throne of Patan at the age of 18 and ruled the city-state between 1684 and 1705 AD.

The history was of leaving the palace and being holy saint. He thought that now it was his turn  He remembered the words of the wise elder who had recommended him to imagine eight impossible things to pass away from this world.\r\nThus King Yog Narendra Malla conjured eight impossible things and proclaimed them. Amongst which the most prominent ones are as follows:\r\nI. When the little golden bird atop the serpents head above my golden statue will fly away straight to heaven, let it be known to my countrymen their Kings' soul shall follow the golden bird in its heavenward flight.\r\nII. For when the stone elephants erected on the stairway of Viswanath temple in front of the Royal Palace step down to the nearby three stone water spouts (Manga Hiti) and drink to their hearts\u2019 content, let it be known King Yog Narendra Malla is no more on Earth.\r\nIII. For when the golden-winged Gaurda seated on the stone pillar opposite the Krishna Temple will lay two pearls as big as the hens\u2019 egg, let it be known King Yog Narendra Malla is no more on Earth.\r\nTill the golden bird stays perched atop the serpents head, the elephants remain standing on the stairway, and the Gaurda doesn\u2019t lay pearls as large as hen\u2019s egg. Let my countrymen know that King Yog Narendra Malla is alive inside his Royal Palace.\r\nAfter proclaiming such impossible things, King Yog Narendra Malla disappeared from his royal palace. His whereabouts were unknown to his wife and daughters. when people heard that The king has died then 31 women went sati. But still, the people of Lalitpur believe that King Yog Narendra Malla is engaged in deep meditation somewhere inside the Royal Palace and he is alive and well.", "additional": "Figurative Sculpture", "phone": "", "email": "", "insta": "https://instagram.com/", "facebook": "https://facebook.com/", "recognition": "", "location": "Patan", "images": ["https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/King_Yog_Narendra_Malla.jpg", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/King_Yog_Narendra_Malla_9ftavDr.jpg", "https://joonshakya.github.io/Arthub-Database-Meida-Files/posts/16df46eeae2eb13b7acdb38ba0645b50.jpg"], "image_name": "joon"}, "geometry": {"coordinates": ["85.3231324", "27.6727028"], "type": "Point"}}]}
