The holy god of Kirat people's located in Kathmandu erected by Kirati kings of ancient Nepal, believed to be an ancestor. It is also known as Kirateswor Mahadev. Kirat people are diverse and therefore their beliefs and deities vary. Birupakshya is also worshipped in South India as Virupaksha.\r\nAn idol of Virupaksha is located in the east of Pashupatinath temple on the right bank of the Bagmati river. Half of the body of Virupaksha lies inside the ground and another half above. The statue is believed to be emerging out slowly. It is believed that the world will be destroyed if the whole statue will come out. Virupaksha is also called kali because his full emergence will end the Kali Yuga.", "additional": "The more the Kali Yuga disappears, the more it is believed that the idol will come up. People who know him also call him the idol of Virupaksha. According to the Sanskrit dictionary, this idol is called \u2018Birupaksha\u2019 because it has an eye in Bitunga, because like Shivaji, this idol also has one eye on its forehead, but the popular folklore in the Kathmandu Valley introduces it as \u2018Birupaksha\u2019 or \u2018Kali\u2019.According to the popular folklore in Kathmandu Valley, \u2018Birupaksha\u2019 is the name of a Kiranti boy. When the boy was young, the boy\u2019s father went abroad to earn money as he had no property at home, but when his son was seven years old, his father did not return home.No matter how many places he searched for, he could not find his father, even though he was seventeen years old. Many years after the disappearance of the father and mother, the mother also went in search of the father and son. Coincidentally, the mother and son came to live in the same shelter. Mother looked young. The mother and son did not know each other, so they had intercourse. When they got up in the morning and started dating, they found out that they were their own mother and child. \r\n\r\nThe beginning of Kali Yuga was after that great sin of Virupaksha\u2019s motherhood. Even now, Kali is still in Nepal as an opponent! I don\u2019t know what the folklore of the mother says, but the son was moved by remorse. He asked Lord Pashupati Nath how he could atone for the sin of motherhood. Pashupati Nath is addicted to poison, cannabis and dhatura, so he told the boy that the sin of motherhood can be absolved only after eating 12 dharnis of copper. The boy has cooked in a pot to melt copper. After heating in the fire for a long time, it is seen that the copper has melted, but the smoke of the copper burning inside the pot has made the boy look black, dirty and ugly. Then the boy\u2019s name became \u2018Birupaksh\u2019 (folklore only understands the meaning of the name \u2018Virupaksh\u2019, \u2018Axis\u2019 does not seem to mean \u2018eyes\u2019). Feeling that Lord Pashupati had deceived him, Birupaksha wanders around the Pashupati area, abusing Shivaji and kicking his idol, and takes refuge in Lord Buddha. The Buddha gives him a rosary of Bodhichitta and instructs him to turn it around until it is untied. The Buddha\u2019s teaching was that when the garland is untied, your sins will be forgiven. Birupaksha turned the garland around where his idol is now, but the garland did not open. Desperate, Birupaksha saw a boy crawling on a stone until an iron sheet died and asked what he had done. The boy said, \u2018Look, my clothes are torn, so I tried to make a needle out of iron! It was Lord Buddha who came in the guise of a boy to inspire Virupaksha to work hard. After getting knowledge from the boy, the garland of Birupaksha was also loosened, but the devotees of Pashupatinath insulted Shivaji and kicked Virupaksha who was kicking his idol and buried him on the bank of the river Bagmati. In order to take revenge on the God who betrays him and the devotees who bury him on the ground, Virupaksha is forcing him to rise from the ground. At the end of Kali Yuga, it is believed that Virupaksha will come out completely. In Pashupati, the idol of a woman near the idol of Birupaksha is believed to be that of Virupaksha\u2019s mother (Kirantini or Yakshini).

Let my countrymen know that King Yog Narendra Malla is alive inside his Royal Palace.\r\nAfter proclaiming such impossible things, King Yog Narendra Malla disappeared from his royal palace.
