Then we performed a ritual when the wife is carried to her husband\u2019s house to stay there. Then life was not easy because I had to follow all my mother-in-law\u2019s orders. My husband has no fixed job, so we did not have much money.\r\n\r\nOne day a foreigner was attracted to my house because I had decorated it with paintings. At that time I was not at home. When I came back, my children told me about that visit and how I could go to apply for a job at JWDC.\r\n\r\nThere I received paper, paint and a pencil for a test painting. I had not seen these things before in all my life. That was eleven years ago.\r\n\r\nOther neighbors already worked there, so society accepted that I take up this work. Now I also ride a bicycle. My children taught me how to do it. In the beginning, I was scared, but now I manage quite well.\r\n\r\nI learned painting at the age of ten from my mother. She used to paint houses for festivals and marriages. I like to paint the Jhijiya dance. It is a dance that is performed during Dashain. The dancers have to carry five clay pots on their heads to worship the goddesses Maharani and Bhagawati.\r\n\r\nFrom the money I earn at JWDC, I can buy rice. I have also met new friends here.

An ascetic and activist Yogmaya challenged the autocratic Rana regime, which did not allow widows to marry, by remarrying two times and playing a pivotal role in abolishing Sati Pratha in 1920. As her protest against the Rana regime's oppression against women and their rights, she along with her 67 disciples committed mass suicide by jumping into the run river in 1941. The mural highlights the feminist role of Yogmaya Neupane in leading the future generation of women and girls. The mural depicts three phases of the life of Yogmaya Neupane: the shawl clad symbolizes her early marriage phase; the section after showcases her decision to go against society and remarry; the third section represents her phase during renunciation. The face and the hand after the third section illustrate today's generation of women who are trying to go beyond the confined boundaries, reclaim their space in society, and explore their unique selves without the fear of social stigma and discrimination. The blue and the green shades on the shawl represent the patriarchal oppression depriving women of basic rights. The triangles in the background are representations of women, and the concentric circles that spread out symbolize the spread of Yogmaya's ideas and her teachings from the past to this day. The text on the right reads \"Truth, Dharma, and Alms', written in Ranjana Lipi- a Brahmi script, are the words of Yogmaya demanding good governance and a gender-just society from the leaders of the Rana regime. The queen bee at the center symbolizes leadership- in this case, the leadership of Yogmaya Neupane for the future generation of women and girls to live their life free from oppression and patriarchal norms. This is an initiative by the Ujyalo Foundation for 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence 2017.

In the past, women painted lively paintings of gods, people, plants, and auspicious animals on the mud walls of their homes. Paintings were made on the occasion of weddings or for festivals such as Deepawali when Goddess Laxmi is worshipped. \r\n\r\nToday few homes have mud walls, and with the popularity of modern houses in brick and cement, the wall painting tradition has not carried on. The Maithil culture remains rich, however, in its festivals and rituals, songs, and folktales, which are reflected in new paintings on paper and in crafts.", "contact": "9812173922", "phone": "9812173922", "website": "", "email": "", "insta": false, "facebook": false, "recognition": "", "images": ["https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/publuc-art-nepal-media-files.appspot.com/o/media%2Fposts%2F1630245653063.jpg?alt=media"], "image_name": "joon", "coordinates": ["85.931190", "26.721147"]}, "geometry": {"coordinates": ["85.931190", "26.721147"], "type": "Point"}}, {"type": "Feature", "place_name": "\ud83c\udfa8 Colorful geometrical elephant", "center": ["77.0653", "28.4552"], "place_type": ["artInfo"], "properties": {"artId": 12, "title": "Colorful geometrical elephant", "slug": "colorful-geometrical-elephant", "artist": "DAAS", "names": "", "location": "Shikshantar School, Old baneshwor", "category": "Painting", "date": "2013", "source": "https://www.artist-daas.com/bio, https://mymodernmet.com/origami-style-street-art-in-nepal/", "what_art_represents": "An elephant full of vivid colors and geometric patterns. On the walls of Shikshantar School in the crowded Kathmandu, lies the famous Geometric Elephant breathing life into the mundane city. Looking closely at the art made by DAAS along with students from the local Shikshantar School, you will see the distinct use of lines and angles, reminding you of the origami folds, blending with cubism to create powerful images. Not having the access to essential items like ladders and scaffolding, the Japan-based Florida artist creatively used 12-foot poles, attaching them with paintbrushes to create a magical effect on the mural.", "artist_description": "Working as an artist for Universal Studios in Osaka, Japan, you will find DAAS masterfully blending cubism and abstract techniques to create his signature vivid and bold murals.
